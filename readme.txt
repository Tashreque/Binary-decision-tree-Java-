This is a binary decision tree based on numerical attributes and examples. The Java program uses examples, attributes, gets threshold, calculates entropy and gathers information gain per node to make a decision. This was trained and tested on some satellite, yeast and pendigits data. OOP concepts were used at all times. The satellite, yeast and pendigits data were in the form of txt files.

Programming language used: Java

Instructions:

-Open terminal, use 'cd' command to change to the directory containing the files, or drag that folder following the cd command in terminal, press enter

-To compile, type "javac dtree.java"
-to execute, type "java dtree argument1 argument2 argument3 argument4"
where argument1 and argument2 are names of training and test data text files respectively.
Argument4 can either be "optimized" or "randomized", press enter
