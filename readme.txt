This is a binary decision tree based on numerical attributes and examples. The Java program uses examples, attributes, gets threshold, calculates entropy and gathers information gain per node to make a decision. This was trained and tested on some satellite, yeast and pendigits data. OOP concepts were used at all times.

Programming language used: Java

Instructions:

-Open terminal, use 'cd' command to change to the directory containing the files, or drag that folder following the cd command in terminal, press enter

-To compile, type "javac dtree.java"
-to execute, type "java dtree argument1 argument2 argument3 argument4"
where argument1 and argument2 are names of training and test data text files respectively.
Argument4 can either be "optimized" or "randomized", press enter
